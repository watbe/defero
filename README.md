Defero
======

A tool to facilitate the anonymous reporting of sexual assualt and other harrassment to authorised officials.

Defero means report or inform (latin).

Important Information
=====

This tool does not encrypt messages or in any sense provide 'secure' communications. 
The reponsibility of SSL and server security lies, of course, with the server owner.

Most importantly, trust lies within the server owner as true anonymity cannot be guaranteed unless tools such as 
Tor are used (which is beyond the skill of the expected audience). Server logs should be discarded where possible.

What does this do?
=====

This tool provides a way for people to anonymously report concerns about a workplace or residential area to 
trusted people. 

As opposed to a simple form, Defero facilitates two-way communication between the reporter and the officer, whilst
maintaining anonymity. This allows officers to follow up reports and provide guideance/support where necessary, and 
if the user is open to such communications.

Background
=====

This tool is the result of discussions at an Australian university about the relatively high incidence
of unreported sexual assaults. This tool is for residents to report things that may be of concern, and 
anonymity is required as the accused may be close friends or intimately involved with the accuser. 

The project is open-source to ensure that the tool can be audited, and also, to provide the code for others to 
use.
